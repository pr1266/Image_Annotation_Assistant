In this project, we implemented a object-tracker based annotation assistant using OpenCV. Output of this program is consist of two parts: 
1 - seperated frames
2 - .txt file that contains object coordinates in normalized YOLO format

### How to Run Code
All you need, is to run object_tracking.py script as below:

```
python object_tracking.py
```
